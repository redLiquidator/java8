javascript : 
1. internal vs external
2. variable datatypes
		string
		number
		boolean
		null
		undefined
		array
		object
		function
		
	*array vs object
	I don't have to open multiple containers.
	array [ , , , , , , ] JS can have more than two datatypes in an array
	JS array doesn have intarray, stringarray....etc
	[ "I" , 1 , true ]
	
	 [ , , ] -> {kEY/VALUE , ...}
	  array             object
	  
	  {name:"mo", name2:"men", name3:"jin"}
		key value
		
	array can have object as its element inside
	object can have array as its element inside
